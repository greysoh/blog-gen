# blog-gen
Command-line tool to convert markdown to html.  
  
Made this because I needed to use my domain for *something*, and I got bored, while waiting for my PC parts to show up.
## Usage
Rename `in-example` to `in`.  
  
Then, install all packages using `npm install`.  
Finally, run it using `npm start`.
